FavColor is a website that helps you find your favorite color. Created to help me practice my JavaScript, it uses a very basic algorithim.

Version 1:
This version uses a very basic algorithim. Rating the color 1 - 5 adjusts the final color by the factor that you rated. The problem with this is that people like shades of multiple colors, so only rating a couple of colors results in grey. But if you rate a lot of colors, the grey starts to bend towards a final color. I tend to fix this problem with future versions.
